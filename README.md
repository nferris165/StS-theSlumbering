# StS-theSlumbering

This is the mod for The Slumbering, a brand new character class for Slay the Spire.

The mod adds a new character, including a set of 77 character specific cards, new neutral cards, curse cards, monsters, relics, events, potions, elites, a new card type, and much more!

Currently, this mod is feature complete, however, I am currently working with a partner to deliver quality art for this mod, so most art in the mod currently is placeholder art. Additionally, values and mechanics are subject to change as further balancing changes occur, and as feedback comes in. This is the first public release of the mod, however I still consider this to be in the beta stages as I gather feedback from the community and make improvements in the future. Thank you for your understanding!

The Slumbering is a creature that has been asleep for so long, it no longer remembers who it is. It has grow frail in its slumber, but has learned how to harness the power of the dream world.

Mechanically, the Slumbering is designed to have a unique difficulty curve. The Slumbering starts with only 1 HP, and cannot gain more through any means. In order to deal with foes, the Slumbering must Block all incoming damage. Fortunately, the Slumbering comes equipped with two starting relics that allow traversal of the Spire with relative safety. The first relic is guided by how awakened the Slumbering is; the more it wakes up, the stronger it becomes. The second relic stores energy from the hearts of those who have passed on. As enemies are defeated, it will collect hearts which can be spent to gain Block for the turn. The amount of Block received is determined by the power level of the first relic. The design goal is for the balancing of slumber level and hearts to create a dynamic way to mitigate damage on the fly.

Additionally, the Slumbering is constantly drifting between the dream world and our reality. This means that during combat, the Slumbering will be afflicted by a Drowsy effect. While Drowsy, the Slumbering will be powered up by it's connection to the dream world, but will not have as much energy to muster for the fight. During combat, the Slumbering will have to plan its strategy according to how much power it wants to siphon from the dream world. But beware of cutting yourself off entirely from the dream world!
Does it try to deal very large amounts of damage from select powerful cards, or does it resist the call of power, and use its large energy pool to defend and stay reactive? The Slumbering has many tools that will benefit different playstyles within the unique set of mechanics that bind it.
